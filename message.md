#### Downtime

The Data Portal, Submission Portal, and Runtime API are exhibiting consistent downtime. We have determined the underlying issue to be at the web hosting level.

In order to restore access as soon as possible, we're in the process of deploying the Data Portal and Submission Portal to a new web host. **We expect them to be online by October 23, 2025.**

In the meantime, you can access a **backup instance** of the Data Portal and Submission Portal at [https://data-backup.microbiomedata.org](https://data-backup.microbiomedata.org), where you can explore and download data. Please do not submit metadata via that instance of the Submission Portal (it will be discarded).
